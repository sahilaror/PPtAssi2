AN 3
	The switch statement is a multi-way branch statement. In simple words, the Java switch statement executes one statement from multiple conditions. It is like an if-else-if ladder statement. It provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression. Basically, the expression can be a byte, short, char, or int primitive data types. It basically tests the equality of variables against multiple values.

ANS 4
	Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

ANS 5
	The Java if-else statement also tests the condition. It executes the if block if condition is true otherwise else block is executed

ANS 6
	The equals() method compares two strings, and returns true if the strings are equal, and false if not.

AMS 7
	Mutable means changing over time or that can be changed. In a mutable string, we can change the value of the string and JVM doesnâ€™t create a new object. In a mutable string, we can change the value of the string in the same object.

ANS 8
	import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class SortingString {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.println("Enter a string value: ");
      String str = sc.nextLine();
      char charArray[] = str.toCharArray();
      Arrays.sort(charArray);
      System.out.println(new String(charArray));
   }
}

ANS 9
class CheckLetter
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		String str = "Umbrella";
		boolean pre = false;
		for(int i = 0;i<str.length();i++)
		{
			if(str.charAt(i) == 'e')
			{
				pre=true;
				break;
			}
		}
		System.out.println(pre);
	}
}

ANS 10
	String pool is nothing but a storage area in Java heap where string literals stores. It is also known as String Intern Pool or String Constant Pool.
